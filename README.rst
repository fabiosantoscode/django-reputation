django-reputation
=================

This is the simplified and cleaned-up version of the django-reputation application that lives here:

Compared to the original one most fundamental changes are:

- reputation permissions are integrated with django's built-in permissions

For a usage example, see the test_project django project.

Requirements:

- django-extensions
- django-appconf
